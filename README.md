This is my very old game. I developed this on Delphi when I was young :)
It uses my 3d engine where grahics rendered with OpenGL and controled with DirectInput 8.
This game is a clone of a classic game BomberMan. Original game is 2d, my game is 3d. You know it's better!
You can ran, you can explode boxes and monsters and you can increase your score.
You can everything in 3D!
